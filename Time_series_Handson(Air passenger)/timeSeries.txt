What is a Time Series?

Definition:
A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular time intervals.
Examples include daily stock prices, monthly sales figures, and yearly rainfall measurements.


Key Components of Time Series

Trend:
The long-term movement or direction in the data over time.
Example: An upward trend in a company’s sales over several years.

Seasonality:
Regular, repeating patterns or cycles in the data.
Example: Higher ice cream sales in the summer months.

Cyclic Patterns:
Fluctuations that are not of a fixed period and can last longer than seasonal patterns.
Example: Economic recessions occurring every few years.

Noise:
Random variations or "white noise" that cannot be attributed to trend, seasonality, or cycles.
Example: Daily fluctuations in stock prices due to unpredictable events.


Key Concepts in Time Series Analysis

Stationarity:
A stationary time series has constant mean and variance over time.
Non-stationary series may show trends or seasonality.

Lag:
The time difference between observations.
Example: Yesterday’s temperature compared to today’s temperature (lag of 1 day).

Autocorrelation:
The correlation of a time series with its own past values.
High autocorrelation means past values strongly influence future values.


Basic Techniques for Analyzing Time Series

Smoothing:
Techniques to reduce noise and highlight patterns.
Example: Moving averages, where each data point is replaced by the average of itself and neighboring points.

Decomposition:
Breaking down a time series into trend, seasonality, and noise components.
Helps in understanding and modeling the data.

Forecasting:
Predicting future values based on past data.
Simple methods include linear regression and exponential smoothing.


Applications of Time Series Analysis
Finance: Stock price prediction, risk management.
Economics: Economic indicators, GDP forecasting.
Weather: Weather forecasting, climate studies.
Healthcare: Disease outbreak prediction, patient monitoring.


In summary, a time series is a collection of data points over time, showing trends, seasonality, and cycles, and is analyzed to identify patterns, reduce noise, and make forecasts
